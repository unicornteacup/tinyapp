# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

The app will track to ensure that only the creator of a shortened URL will be able to edit or delete that short URL. 

Additional features to be added at a later stage:
- tracking the date the short URL was created
- tracking the number of times the short URL was visited
- tracking the number of unique visits for the short URL
